Exercise 1 Think about different scenarios
This exercise involves you using imagination and logical reasoning to occupy the mindset of a visualiser facing the task of formulating a brief for different scenarios. Imagine you are given the challenge of creating a visualisation in each of the following made-up scenarios relating to the subject of Gold prices.

Scenario A: A broadsheet newspaper (see The Guardian – UK) reporting on the regional gold prices after the Covid-19 pandemic.
Scenario B: Analysts at the Bank of England providing business intelligence reporting to support operational colleagues.
Scenario C: Presentation to the UN (United Nations) demonstrating the effect of economic uncertainty on gold prices globally.

Compile a presentation (no more than 6 slides) outlining your assumptions, definitions and ideas about the context and vision for each of the scenarios presented above. Get into the mindset of the potential creators and audiences. If you were them what do you think you might be faced with in terms of requirements, constraints, needs and possibilities?
More specifically: 
1.	Outline what you think might be the main message behind each scenario is.
2.	Articulate what you imagine the purpose of the work associated with each scenario would be: how might success, impact or effectiveness be expressed and measured? 
3.	Sketch out your ideas about what you think the visual work for each scenario looks like in your mind’s eye: what colours, forms, keywords, layouts, thoughts come to mind when you think about the subject at hand? 
4.	What other work can you find through research or past experience that may offer inspiration, influence or reference for your thinking?
There is no need to do any data extraction or analysis, just use your imagination for what data could exist and could be available. There is no perfect answer, no right and no wrong: it is about using a degree of practical imagination and empathy (your ability to occupy the mindset of others). You will need to make many assumptions and take the initiative to define things yourself.



Exercise 2: Dashboard with 3 visualisations
 
You are tasked to identify and use a dataset. You are allowed to use any type of data based on the restrictions below:
•	You are not allowed to use dataset that includes pictures, of any kind.
•	You are not allowed to use dataset that is not referenced properly and is not free to use.
•	You are not allowed to use dataset that includes children, illegal, sexist, criminal, explicit, racist or abusive content of any kind.
•	You are not allowed to collect own data.
•	You are not allowed to develop your own dataset (mock data), but you are allowed to perform data cleaning.

You are tasked to create one dashboard with three visualisations.

Dashboard and visualisations must follow the rules below: 
•	There must be a main, coherent message for the dashboard and navigation.
•	At least one of the visualisations must include forecasting.
•	At least one of the visualisations must include trends.
•	All visualisations should be of different type to each other but complimentary.
•	All visualisations axes should be of different to each other but of complimentary context that match the dashboard. In other words, do not duplicate the same chart based on different chart types.

You must use Tableau to create your dashboard.
The dashboard has to present a coherent message, and to be addressed to a specific audience. 
You can create more than visualizations, but they will not get extra marks. 
Feel free to consult this list for your dataset identification.
